I’ve just finished building my Photography Portfolio Website — a space where I can showcase
my love for photography, but this time, through code. 
Inspired by Pinterest’s aesthetic grid style, this project blends my passion for visuals with creativity in web design. 
Designed to be minimal, clean, 
and immersive, it captures my vision of simplicity and storytelling — frame by frame.
Working on this project allowed me to deepened my frontend development skills —
from layout design and responsive styling to interactivity and performance.
